Description: A library to program the performance monitoring events
 Libpfm4 helps convert from an event name, expressed as a string, to
 the event encoding. The encoding can then be used with specific OS
 interfaces. Libpfm4 also provides OS-specific interfaces to directly
 setup OS-specific data structures to be passed to the kernel. The
 current libpfm4, for instance, provides support for the perf_events
 interface which was introduced in Linux v2.6.31.

Description: Python bindings for libpfm4
 This package allows you to write simple python scripts that monitor
 various hardware performance monitoring events. It may be more efficient
 to use this approach instead of parsing the output of other tools.
