libpfm_intel_ivbep_unc_cbo - support for Intel Ivy Bridge-EP C-Box uncore PMU
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>
.sp
.B PMU name: ivbep_unc_cbo[0-7]
.B PMU desc: Intel Ivy Bridge-EP C-Box uncore PMU
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge C-Box (coherency engine) uncore PMU.
This PMU model only exists on Ivy Bridge model 62. There is one C-box
PMU per physical core. Therefore there are up to fifteen identical C-Box PMU instances
numbered from 0 to 14. On dual-socket systems, the number refers to the C-Box
PMU on the socket where the program runs. For instance, if running on CPU15, then
ivbep_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely,
if running on CPU0, then the same ivbep_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical
core 0 but on socket 0.

Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter registers used only
with certain events and umasks.

.SH MODIFIERS
The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge C-Box uncore PMU:
.TP
.B e
Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.
.TP
.B t
Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter counts the number
of C-Box cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:255].
.TP
.B nf
Node filter. Certain events, such as UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP, UNC_C_LLC_VICTIMS, provide a \fBNID\fR umask.
Sometimes the \fBNID\fR is combined with other filtering capabilities, such as opcodes.
The node filter is an 8-bit max bitmask. A node corresponds to a processor
socket. The legal values therefore depend on the underlying hardware configuration. For
dual-socket systems, the bitmask has two valid bits [0:1].
.TP
.B cf
Core Filter. This is a 3-bit filter which is used to filter based on physical core origin
of the C-Box request. Possible values are 0-7. If the filter is not specified, then no
filtering takes place.
.TP
.B tf
Thread Filter. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to filter C-Box requests based on logical
processor (hyper-thread) identification. Possibles values are 0-1. If the filter is not
specified, then no filtering takes place.
.TP
.B nc
Non-Coherent. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to filter C-Box requests only for the
TOR_INSERTS and TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the filter is not
specified, then no filtering takes place.
.TP
.B isoc
Isochronous. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to filter C-Box requests only for the
TOR_INSERTS and TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the filter is not
specified, then no filtering takes place.

.SH Opcode filtering

Certain events, such as UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS supports opcode matching on the C-BOX transaction
type. To use this feature, first an opcode matching umask must be selected, e.g., MISS_OPCODE.
Second, the opcode to match on must be selected via a second umask among the OPC_* umasks.
For instance, UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:OPCODE:OPC_RFO, counts the number of TOR insertions for RFO
transactions. 

Opcode matching may be combined with node filtering with certain umasks. In general, the
filtering support is encoded into the umask name, e.g., NID_OPCODE supports both
node and opcode filtering. For instance, UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:NID_OPCODE:OPC_RFO:nf=1.
