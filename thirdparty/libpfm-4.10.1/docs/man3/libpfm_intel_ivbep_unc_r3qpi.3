.SH DESCRIPTION
The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge R3QPI uncore PMU.
This PMU model only exists on Ivy Bridge model 62.

.SH MODIFIERS
The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge R3PQI  uncore PMU:
.TP
.B e
Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.
.TP
.B t
Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter counts the number
of R3QPI cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:15].
